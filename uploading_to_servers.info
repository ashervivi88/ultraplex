# For bioconda

Here we use the pip package as a skeleton

Download and fork bioconda:

1. git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/bioconda-recipes.git
2. cd bioconda-recipes
3. git remote add upstream https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes.git
4. git checkout master
5. git pull upstream master
6. git checkout -b ultraplex_fork

Make the meta.yaml from the pip package

1. cd recipes
2. conda skeleton pypi pyaml
3. Add noarch: python to the build section of the meta.yaml file that's generated
4. git add ultraplex_fork
5. git commit
6. git push

Then finally:

1. Create a pull request and make sure it passes the tests.
2. https://gitter.im/bioconda/lobby <- go here and ask for it to be merged
3. Once it's merged and definitely on Bioconda, delete the branch
